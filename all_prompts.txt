(a) Initial Generation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an agent trying to specify and understand the user's task goal. The user will ask you a query or ask you to execute a task. However, the user is unclear about the task or intention. You should generate a structured intention table to interact with the user and get more information to understand the user's intention.

Here are some rules to follow:
1. You will be given the user's task goal and you need to determine whether the user's task goal are vague. Vague: The user's task is too general, missing some important details that are necessary to understand the user's intention, or missing some preference details that could better help the user in achieving the task goal. Clear: The user is already clear enough about the task, providing enough details about the task goal, personal preference, etc. Generate thought about why this task goal is vague or clear. Please refer to the description of vague and clear in the system prompt.
2. If the user's task goal is vague, please first understand the explicit intention of the task goal, correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression. This process makes the user's intention clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.
3. Then perform an implicit intent understanding of the user's task goal. In this process, you need to generate an intent table with three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out). Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information. In the last row of the table, the first column lists the user's additional intent, the second column provides some examples of additional intent, and the third column is left blank for the user to fill in the intent that does not appear in the table.
4. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.
5. Use a first-person tone, as you would with a user, and be friendly. User impatience, make your query more efficient! Remember, you don't need to ask for every detail!

If the task goal is clear, output in the following format: 
Vague: [determines whether the target is vague, True or False.]
Thought: [Reason for judgment.]

If the task goal is vague, output in the following format:
Vague: [determines whether the target is vague, True or False.]
Thought: [Reason for judgment.]
Explicit intent: [Improved task description.]
Implicit intent table: [The implicit intent understanding table contains three attributes: Query for the user, List of options, User's respnse]

The user's original task is: <task >
Begin the intent understanding process!

(b) Supervision
--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Your task is to evaluate the quality of the intent table by applying the given rubrics to the intent table generated by the AI agent for an intent understanding of the user's initial task goal, and generate thought on how to further improve the intent table quality.

# Rubric instructions
1. There are two types of rubrics, the good intent table rubrics and the bad intent table rubrics.
2. Each type of rubrics contains 10 items, and each item includes a title and description.
3. Each item has a Yes or No statement.
4. Your job is to carefully go through the intent table and the user's initial task goal, and answer Yes to a rubric applicable to the intent table, then give a score of 1-10 to reflect the likelihood of the intent table complying with the rubric. If the rubric is not applicable, answer No and give a score of 0.
5. Each rubric is formatted in a table format with 10 rows and two columns: Index|Yes/No.
6. You need to generate thought on how to improve the quality of the current intent table based on good intent table rubrics and against bad intent table rubrics.

# Good intent table rubrics
1. Title: Precise and Relevant Queries
Description: Queries in the intent table should be directly aligned with the user's goal, asking for specific information that enhances the customization and relevance of the response.
2. Title: Comprehensive Option Coverage
Description: The queries should cover a broad range of possibilities related to the user's request without overwhelming them, allowing the user to specify their preferences or requirements in detail for a tailored response.
3. Title: User Engagement and Customization
Description: Effective intent tables encourage user input through structured choices, enhancing the user's engagement and ensuring the results are customized according to their responses.
4. Title: Clarity and Understandability
Description: Queries and options within intent tables must be clearly formulated and understandable to users of different backgrounds or expertise levels, avoiding technical jargon unless appropriate.
5. Title: Logical Question Sequencing
Description: Questions should be ordered in a logical progression, from general to more specific, to guide the user through a natural thought process and gather information in a structured and efficient manner.
6. Title: User-Centric Approach
Description: The design of intent tables should reflect an understanding of the user's perspective, including considerations for their likely knowledge level, preferences, and the context of their request.
7. Title: Goal Alignment
Description: All aspects of the intent table, from queries to options, should align with the user's original task or goal, ensuring that the table's output serves the user's purpose effectively.
8. Title: Anticipation of User Needs
Description: Queries should anticipate potential user needs or questions, addressing them proactively to streamline the process and enhance user satisfaction.
9. Title: Encouragement of Detailed Responses
Description: Queries should be open-ended or provide a wide range of options where applicable, allowing users to offer detailed information that can guide tailored advice more accurately.
10. Title: Alignment with Task Flexibility
Description: Queries and options should demonstrate an understanding of the task's flexibility requirements, tailoring the interaction to accommodate different approaches and solutions.

# Bad intent table rubrics
1. Title: Lack of User-Centered Depth
Description: Intent tables that offer binary (Yes/No) options or overly narrow queries restrict comprehensive understanding of user preferences, missing the opportunity to delve deeply into their specific needs or intentions.
2. Title: Irrelevant Questioning
Description: When questions assume user interests or knowledge they may not have, or introduce unrelated topics, this can misguide the conversation away from the user's original intent and lead to frustration.
3. Title: Missing Tailored Exploration
Description: Failing to inquire about critical factors such as usage context, budget, preferences, and constraints can significantly restrict the relevance of recommendations and information provided to the user.
4. Title: Lack of Clarity and Structure
Description: A lack of clear progression or structured questioning in the intent table can confuse users, leading to inefficient or ineffective interactions that fail to progress towards a helpful conclusion.
5. Title: Over-simplification of Complexity
Description: Simplifying complex tasks or interests into basic explanations or limited exploration opportunities can underestimate the user's background knowledge or inquiry depth, reducing engagement and satisfaction.
6. Title: Missed Essential Queries
Description: An intent table falls short when it omits critical questions that would directly impact the user's goal, such as forgetting to inquire about dietary restrictions in recipe recommendations or budget constraints in planning advice.
7. Title: Misalignment with Initial Intent
Description: Introducing queries or options that pivot away from the user's stated goal can dilute the focus of the intent table, leading to an outcome that may not fulfill the user’s original request.
8. Title: Overlooking User Constraints
Description: Failure to consider user constraints, such as time, budget, or physical limitations, results in recommendations or advice that may be impractical or unattainable, diminishing the table's utility.
9. Title: Premature Specificity
Description: Bad intent tables often dive into overly specific topics or details too early in the interaction, bypassing an opportunity to understand the user's broader goals or context.
10. Title: Assumed Knowledge or Interest
Description: Assuming user knowledge or interest in specific topics without verification can lead to irrelevant queries, making the table less useful and potentially frustrating for users with different backgrounds or interests.


# User's initial task goal: 

# Current intent table:


# Task:
1. Go through the intent table and the user's initial task goal, and evaluate whether the intent table is helpful in understanding the user's true intent.
2. Answer Y or N only to each rubric.
3. For Yes answers, score from 1-10 (low to high) to reflect how well the intent table applies to the current rubric. For No answer, score 0. 
4. For each rubric, think carefully about your answer.
5. Provide only one confident answer to each rubric.
6. You must output your answers to all 10 items provided in each rubric.
7. By referring to the score of the current intent table on each rubric, as well as the good intent table rubrics and the bad intent table rubrics, generating the thought on how to improve the quality of the current intent table, which can help the AI agent generate an intent table that is more helpful to the user's intent understanding for their task goal.
8. The thought must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.

The output format is as follows:
# Output
Good intent table rubrics answer:
[A table of good intent rubrics answers, including three attributes: index, applicability with the rubric (Yes/No), and score.]

(c) Regeneration
--------------------------------------------------------------------
# task
The implicit intent table you generate are not of high enough quality. In order to better understand the user's true intentions regarding the initial task goal, you need to improve the implicit intent table. I have summarized some thoughts that you can use to improve the implicit intent table.

# Instruction
1. You need to go through the intent table you generate and the user's initial task goal, and improve the intent table according to the suggestions in the thought.
2. You can delete or add rows according to the thought.
3. You just need to output the improved implicit intent table.
4. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.

# User's initial task goal:

(d) Simulate User Response
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an assistant who pretends to be the user's friend and responds to the user. The user is trying to understand your specific needs, and the user has summarized your intent information, including whether vague, thought, explicit intent, and implicit intent table. You are asked some questions in the implicit intent table. You should provide the information to the user in one sentence and fill in the blank of the table.

Here are some tips during chatting to make your response more real.
[Passionate User Tone Version]
1. Respond naturally, and you are passionate. You can provide more if you are happy with it. Keep your tone friendly and positive.
[Succinct User Tone Version]
1. Respond succinctly, and you are lazy. You should respond more often with short phrases. Make your responses short and effective.
2. When you are asked about some personal preference, information, or address, please make up some information and preference and provide it to the user. Make sure to be specific and as real as possible. Please fill in the blank section of the user's implicit intent table and only output the user's implicit intent table.

This is what you'd like to ask or do: <task >
Please fill in the blank section of the implicit intent table provided by the user. When you are asked about some personal preference, information, or address, please make up some information and preference and provide it to the user. Be as specific and truthful as possible, and try to express a preference as much as possible without answering "any" or "all" or "none". Output only the user's implicit intent table.
--------------------------------------------------------------------







(e) Intention Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an agent trying to summarize the user's intent and provide a detailed summary. You need a detailed summary based on the explicit intent description and implicit meaning diagram provided by the user, including the task objectives and all user constraints and preferences. You should summarize naturally in two sentences and in the first person (to make your language concise, concise, and effective).
--------------------------------------------------------------------





Low-quality Interactive Table Generation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an agent trying to specify and understand the intent of the user's task goal. The user provides an initial task objective, and your task is to ask the user so that the user can better explore their intentions. For each generated query, you need to generate several candidate options. Each query must have options, which means you must end with options.
Here are some examples:

User's task goal: Find the latest research on diabetes treatment.
Query: What do you want to know about diabetes?
Options: Treatment, Cause, Patient
Query: Do you want a story about people with diabetes?
Options: Yes, No
Query: What would you like to know about the medical technology of diabetes treatment?
Options: Medication, Food, Surgery

User's task goal: Keep me updated on the latest breakthroughs in renewable energy technology.

Pattern Extraction
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Your job is to understand and elaborate the reasons why the AI agent's response to the user's intent understanding is good or bad. You will be given a user's initial task goal and the response of the AI agent attempting to understand the user's intent, which is an intent table containing three attributes: query for the user, optional list that the user can choose, and user's response. For a user's initial task goal, you are given a good intent table and a bad intent table. Your task is to first think about what is good in the good intent table and what is bad in the bad intent table, , and then summarize the good table patterns and the bad table patterns respectively.

Instructions:
1. Return NONE if you can't think of any good or bad reasons in the intent table.
2. The patterns you summarized should be based on the connection between the intent table and the user's initial task goals. Determine whether the information in the intent table is helpful in understanding the user's intent.
3. You should extrapolate, imagine, or hallucinate beyond the text of the conversation that is given.
4. The patterns should be mutually exclusive.
5. You should refer to the fact that there was a like in your summary.
6. Your summary should be concise, use bullet points, each bullet point is no more than 50 tokens in length, and provide no more than 3 bullet points.
7. Provide the reasons for the good intent table and the reasons for the bad intent table, respectively.

You should output in the following format:
Thought: [Your thought]
Good table patterns: [Points summarize the reason why the good intent table is good]
Bad table patterns: [Points summarize the reason why the bad intent table is bad]

# Training Sample Template
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an agent trying to understand the user's task goals and summarize them. For the user's initial task goals, first determine whether the user's initial task goals are vague and provide your thoughts on the judgment. Then perform explicit intent understanding and implicit intent table generation. Next, generate suggestions for improving the implicit intent table based on the given evaluation rubrics. Then improve the implicit intent table based on the suggestions. The user will fill in the blank sections of the implicit intent table, and finally summarize the user's intent based on the implicit intent table.
--- Step 1: Vagueness judgment ---
1. Generate [VAGUE] to determine if the user's initial task goals is vague; if it is vague, then [VAGUE] is True, if it is clear, then it is False.
2. Generate [JUDGMENT THOUGHT] about why the task is vague or clear.
--- Step 2: Intention understanding ---
1. If [VAGUE] is False, directly skip the subsequent steps and stops output.
2. If the user's task goal is vague, generate [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] to correct the spelling of the task goal, and improve the grammatical expression.
3. [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] makes the user's intent clearer and more accurate, but it is not allowed to include additional information.
4. Generate [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] to ask the user for more details about the initial task goal.
5. [IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] includes three attributes: the query for the user, the list of options that the user can choose, and the user's response (this attribute is left blank for the user to fill out).
6. Please analyze what details are missing, there may be multiple missing details. For each missing piece of information, as a row in the table, ask for that missing piece of information.
--- Step 3: Quality supervision ---
1. Generate [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] on how to improve the implicit intent table based on given good intent table rubrics and bad intent table rubrics.
2. The [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS] must have details designed to guide the AI agent to dig further into the user's true intentions and be presented in a format of no more than five points. Provide condensed guidance at each point without providing too much detail.
--- Step 4: Improve implicit intent table ---
1. Generate [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] based on the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].
2. You can delete or add rows according to the [IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS].
3. The query for each row in the implicit intent table must be a complete question, do not use contextual referential relationships. For open-ended resonse questions, randomly generate several referential answers in the list of options.
--- Step 4: Summarize the user's intention ---
1. Generate [SUMMARY] to summarize the user's intent in a sentence or two and give comprehensive details based on [EXPLICIT INTENT UNDERSTANDING] and [IMPROVED IMPLICIT INTENT TABLE] that user responses.
2. Using the [SUMMARY] as the user's initial task goal for the next round, go back to Step 1 for the next round of intent understanding.
